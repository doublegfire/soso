<h2>TOP spot in The City.</h2>
<p>These are places to have your last meal.</p>
<h3>Here are some places I'd like you to visit</h3>

 	<a href="http://villagrande-texmex.com/">
 		<h1> Villa Grande Mexican Restaurant</h1>
   </a>
   <p> Every time we visit this place, we are always seated right away. The food comes very quickly. I usually order the tamales or the enchilada plate and they both are very tasty. House margaritas are so-so, but the price is right and service is fast.</p>

			      	  <h1 class="brown"> Sweet Georgia Brown Bar-B-Que Buffet</h1> 
                             </a>
                       <p>This place always has a line outside of their restaurant which didn't bother me ANY. That just let me know what was inside is worth the wait.
					   Everyone working there treats you like family and looks like family. They work hard to feed you hot food and keep their tables clean for other to sit.
					   It's a buffet style by order but you do not eat all you can. You can order 3 sides and however many pieces of meats you'd like. They give you MORE than enough to eat and take home.
					  The food tastes just like your families during the holidays! I loved it! I can't wait to come back, even though it'll probably be months from now. Make sure you've ran all of your errands for the day before dining here. You're going to be too full afterwards to do any good!

						 <h1> Slow Bone </h1>
						 </a>
					     <p>I can honestly say this place made me fall in love with brisket!!! I was actually never really a fan of BBQ until someone took me to slow bone. You can really taste the REAL SMOKE in every bite. They also have 3 different bbq sauce to add to your choice of meat. I have been here several times and every time I leave AMAZED. 
						 the portions are huge, I am 5'10 215 lbs and I cant finish a 2 meat plate. I am not the only one who loves this place, does not matter when you come they are packed! In fact they have pretty much out grown the location. 
						I recommend not parking next door, they will tow you lol. They have additional parking across the street due to extreme demand for their food!!!</p>

				      		<h1> Uno Pizza </h1>
						    </a>
						    <p>My favorite place to stop for dinner when I am in Sundance Square! It's a bit out of the way without the high price tag of the restaurants on the square. There can be a bit of a wait on weekends but normally during the week it's empty.The drinks are reasonably priced for where you are. The wine selection is standard but nothing fancy which is fine with me. The draft list is also normal with coors, miller, blue moon etc. The mixed drinks are supposed to be great from what I have heard as well but I can't vouch for those.

						 <h1> Y.O Steakhouse </h1>

                         <p>Amazing food. Amazing service. They offer many grilled vegetables and they have a lot of different protein options on the menu as well. Chicken/steak/buffalo/snake/fish.. you name it, they have it! They make their own homemade ice cream as well. Very cool atmosphere inside and they also offer outdoor patio seating.
